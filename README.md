## üöÄ What It Does

CheckedExceptions is a Roslyn analyzer that makes exception handling **explicit**.  
If a method might throw an exception, the caller must either:

- Handle it (with `try/catch`), or
- Declare it (with `[Throws(typeof(...))]`)

‚úÖ Inspired by Java‚Äôs checked exceptions.  
‚öôÔ∏è Fully opt-in.  
üí° Analyzer warnings by default, errors if you choose.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Example

```csharp
public class Sample
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // ‚ö†Ô∏è THROW001: Unhandled exception type 'InvalidOperationException'
        Perform();
    }

    [Throws(typeof(InvalidOperationException))]
    public void Perform()
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Oops!");
    }
}
```

‚úîÔ∏è Fix it by **handling**:

```csharp
public void Execute()
{
    try { Perform(); }
    catch (InvalidOperationException) { /* handle */ }
}
```

Or by **declaring**:

```csharp
[Throws(typeof(InvalidOperationException))]
public void Execute()
{
    Perform();
}
```

---

## üß† Why Use It?

- Avoid silent exception propagation
- Document intent with `[Throws]` instead of comments
- Enforce better error design across your codebase
- Works with unannotated .NET methods via XML docs
- Plays nice with nullable annotations
- Avoid confusing [Throws] with `<exception>` ‚Äî enforce contracts, not just documentation

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Sundstrom.CheckedExceptions
```

And define `ThrowsAttribute` in your project:

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Constructor | AttributeTargets.Delegate, AllowMultiple = true)]
public class ThrowsAttribute : Attribute
{
    public List<Type> ExceptionTypes { get; } = new();
    public ThrowsAttribute(Type exceptionType, params Type[] others) { ‚Ä¶ }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### .editorconfig

```ini
dotnet_diagnostic.THROW001.severity = warning
dotnet_diagnostic.THROW003.severity = warning
```

### `.csproj`

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WarningsAsErrors>nullable,THROW001</WarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### JSON Settings

Add `CheckedExceptions.settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ignoredExceptions": [ "System.ArgumentNullException" ],
  "informationalExceptions": {
    "System.IO.IOException": "Propagation",
    "System.TimeoutException": "Always"
  }
}
```

Register in `.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AdditionalFiles Include="CheckedExceptions.settings.json" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## ü™™ Diagnostic Codes

| ID         | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `THROW001` | Unhandled exception: must be caught or declared |
| `THROW003` | Avoid general `Exception` in `[Throws]` |
| `THROW004` | Avoid throwing `Exception` directly |
| `THROW005` | Duplicate `[Throws]` declarations |
| `THROW006` | Declared on override, missing from base |
| `THROW007` | Declared on base, missing from override |

---

## üõ† Code Fixes

The analyzer offers the following automated code fixes:

- ‚úÖ **Add `[Throws]` declaration** ‚Äì Adds a `[Throws(typeof(...))]` attribute to declare the exception.
- üßØ **Surround with try/catch** ‚Äì Wraps the statement in a `try` block with a generated `catch`.
- üßØ **Add catch to existing try block** ‚Äì Appends a new `catch` clause to a nearby `try` block.
- ü™õ **Suppress warning** ‚Äì Adds `#pragma warning disable` or `[SuppressMessage]`.

---

## ‚ú® Advanced Features

- Supports lambdas, local functions, accessors, events
- Analyzes exception inheritance trees
- Merges `[Throws]` with `<exception>` from XML docs
- Handles nullability context (`#nullable enable`)  
- Understands standard library exceptions (e.g. `Console.WriteLine` ‚Üí `IOException`)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### ‚ùì How is this different from Java's checked exceptions?

**Answer:**

Java's checked exceptions are **mandatory** ‚Äî the compiler enforces them, and every method must declare or handle them. While this promotes visibility, it also leads to friction, boilerplate, and workarounds like `throws Exception`.

This analyzer takes a **modern, flexible approach**:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings by default**, not errors ‚Äî you‚Äôre in control.
* ‚úçÔ∏è **Opt-in declaration** using `[Throws]` ‚Äî only where it matters.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Code fixes and suppression** make adoption practical.
* üîÑ **Gradual adoption** ‚Äî use it for new code, leave legacy code untouched.
* üéØ **Focused on intention**, not obligation ‚Äî you declare what callers need to know, not what `int.Parse` might throw.

> ‚úÖ Summary:
> This is *exception design with intent*, not enforcement by force. It improves exception hygiene without the rigidity of Java‚Äôs model.

### ‚ùì Can I use `<exception>` XML documentation tags instead of the `[Throws]` attribute?

**Answer:**

No ‚Äî for your own code, `<exception>` tags are **not treated as semantic declarations** by the analyzer. While they are useful for documentation and IntelliSense, they are not part of the C# language‚Äôs type system and cannot be reliably analyzed or enforced.

Instead, we encourage and require the use of the `[Throws]` attribute for declaring exceptions in a way that is:

- Explicit and machine-readable  
- Suitable for static analysis and enforcement  
- Integrated with code fixes and tooling support

#### üß© Interoperability with external libraries

When analyzing external APIs (e.g., referenced .NET assemblies), we **do** recognize `<exception>` tags from their XML documentation ‚Äî but only for **interop purposes**. That is:

- We treat documented exceptions from public APIs as "declared" when `[Throws]` is not available.
- This helps maintain compatibility without requiring upstream changes.
- However, this behavior **does not apply** to code within your own solution.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Summary:  
> `<exception>` tags are respected for **interop**, but they are **not a replacement** for `[Throws]` in code you control.

### ‚ùì What about .NET Standard 2.0 support?

**Answer:**

The analyzer offers **limited support** for projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0. You‚Äôll still get accurate diagnostics for your own code, as well as third-party libraries. However, members defined in the .NET Standard framework may not indicate which exceptions they throw.

This is due to a **technical limitation**: the XML documentation files for .NET Standard assemblies are often incomplete or malformed, making it impossible to extract reliable exception information.

‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Target a modern .NET SDK (e.g., .NET 6 or later) to get full analyzer support, including framework exception annotations.
